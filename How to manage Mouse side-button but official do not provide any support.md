XMBC is a free tool for Windows that allows you to re-configure and remap mouse buttons to expand the capabilities of your mouse(reference by the official site)

Through [CPS Check](https://cps-check.com/cn/mouse-buttons-test) (ps: using chrome will be better according the site introduction) you can find if your mouse side-buttons working or can be detected by your system.

Once you find it can be accessed by your OS, XMBC will be a suitable choice.
